                <p><i>By Danielle Li</i></p>
                <p></p>
                 <p>On the heels of its Olympic debut and Alex Honnold's genre-defying ropeless ascent of El Capitan, rock climbing is experiencing a surge in popularity.  Over the past 10 years, the number of indoor climbing gyms has more than doubled, from just over 250 in 2011 to just under 600 in 2021, attracting a new generation of more urban and demographically diverse climbers.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" style="color:#338fb1" >1</a></sup>  In many of the newest facilities, walls are sleek, membership is expensive, and tampons are available in all restrooms regardless of gender.  </p>

                 <p>Yet, as new climbers venure outdoors, they face a different environment and culture.  While gym routes are set with plastic holds, unnamed and reset every few weeks, outdoor rock climbing is defined by the permanence of rock walls, and the lore that arises when generations attempt to find a path up.  Rather than simply being "set," outdoor routes are "established" and the first person to ascend a route is typically awarded the right to name it.  That name is then catalogued in guidebooks, referenced in online forums, and, occasionally, memorialized in <a style="color:#338fb1"  href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286916/">documentaries</a>. </p> 

                 <p>Some of these names are offensive.  While some routes with explicit racial slurs such as "Wetback Express" have been <a style="color:#338fb1" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112473633/expressway">renamed</a>, the practice of renaming is controversial, especially for many routes with sexualized or gendered language.</p>

                 <p>An analysis of climbing route names in the United States using data from <a style="color:#338fb1"  href="https://openbeta.io/">OpenBeta.io</a>  
                     indicates that there are many potentially offensive route names.  For example, the map below presents 504 route names with terms that are typically used to reference women in derogatory ways (e.g. "bitch" or "whore") or which reference female anatomy (e.g. "pussy" or "tits"). These include names such as "Filthy Whore" and "Show Us Your Tits." </p>

                     <iframe title="Welcome to the great outdoors...bitch." aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-O7G2z" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O7G2z/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="797"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                     </script>

  <p>
    If search terms are expanded to include gendered terms that are not explicitly derogatory but which are often so in context (e.g. "chick," "girly"), the list of potentially sexist route names increases to 817.  If the search is further broadened to include explicitly sexual terms (e.g. "sex", "fuck"), the set of matches increases to over 1,700 routes.  Expanding the search terms again to include terms referencing male sexual anatomy (e.g. "boner", "dick") adds about 500 additonal matches. These numbers likely underestimate the true number of such routes because they exclude terms whose meanings depend on context (e.g. "hole," "plow"). 
 </p>
 <p>In total, routes with misogynistic language or terms referencing sexual acts or anatomy represent about 1.5% of all climbing routes in the OpenBeta data. Is that rare or common?  For context, the next figure benchmarks the frequency of sexualized route names against the frequency of words describing the physical features of rock climbs themselves. </p>
                

                <iframe title="How often is too often?" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-RAfi4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RAfi4/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="629"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                </script>
             
     <p>
      Taken together, the number of routes with misogynistic or explicitly sexual language is approximately equivalent to the number of routes that feature the word "arete," a term describing the corner of a wall, and the second most common word found in route names.  Individually, the word "bitch" is about twice as common as the word "jug," a description of a secure climbing hold.

     <p>
     So who named these routes?  While data on first ascentionists is incomplete, a glance at the names of those credited in the interactive map suggests a pattern: men.
